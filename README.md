Lucky Draw 抽奖模块


The application is separated into two different parts :
+ The dashboard (backend directory)
+ The end-user pages (frontend directory)

## Dashboard
The goal of the dashboard is to make easy to set up new luckydraw campaign for the client.

You can have a look about the different parts and settings offered / needed from the client in this [document](dashboard-client-settings.md).

## End-User pages
The End-User pages are the visible part of the application to the public. It's mostly a SPA for mobile.
